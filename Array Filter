Problem statement
Create a React app and utilize the ES6+ array iteration method to filter the even number from the array and render them.
const numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];


Expected Output:
ES6 Array Iteration Methods /*(for heading use h1 tag)*/
0
2
4
6
8
10


Hint:
Use the map and filter function to render the even numbers.

Test Cases:
The app should render the data correctly


For the given array, 6 elements should be rendered on the screen using the h3 tag, and the rendered item should be even.
